        <h1>This is my first commit in my new dev environment.</h1>
        <p>Just like pipeline stages, environment setups vary. The following setup is common:
            <ul>
                <li>dev: a development-only place for adding new code, kept locally on a developer's computer</li>
                <li>test: a testing-only place for verifying that code is good enough to publish, hosted on a private server</li>
                <li>prod: the live "production" version of a product, hosted online for users to see</li>
            </ul>
         </p>
